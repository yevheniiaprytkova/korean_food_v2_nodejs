# The Best Korean Restaurants in Melbourne

I really enjoy Korean cuisine, especially Korean BBQ and bulgogi 🤤. That's why I created this Single Page Application(SPA) to save all places that I love, revisit them with my friends and add reviews, so next time we know what is really yummy and what we don't like. Also I am interesting in learning Web Development. After finishing course about Node.js (https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/), I thought that this project is a good place to practice it.

In this SPA you can find short overview of each korean restaurant, such as rating from Google Maps, address and distance from home, open hours, personal rating depends on your reviews and, of course, link to the actual restaurant site. Also you can sort them by rating and distance, and add new places.

To deal with places and reviews, I used a REST API and CRUD operations with MongoDB database (Mongoose - MongoDB JS driver) locally and on the Atlas platform (in the cloud). I have used Express (Node.js framework), Postman (to check the URLs), server-side website rendering (HTML) with Pug and Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
